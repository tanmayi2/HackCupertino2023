### By Allison Yu, Savi Kolari, Tanmayi Dasari, and Tiffany Wang

## **Purpose:** 
Users can browse cuisine recipes from all around the world and further connect with different cultures.

## **Process:**

We found a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alaknandaa/recipes-data-by-cuisine?resource=download) and filtered the dataset into 4720 recipies from 33 different cuisines.

Then, we used plotly and the dataset to create a map which catorogizes foods by cuisine. Hovering over an area shows the cuisine in that specific country. Clicking on the country expands a list of all the recipies listed from that cuisine.
