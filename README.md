# HackCupertino2023: InFuse

By Allison Yu, Savi Kolari, Tanmayi Dasari, and Tiffany Wang

#
## **Purpose:** 
Users can browse cuisine recipes from all around the world and further connect with different cultures.

## **Process:**

We found a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alaknandaa/recipes-data-by-cuisine?resource=download) and filtered the dataset into recipies from 33 different cuisines.

Then, we used plotly and the dataset to create a map which catorogizes foods by cuisine. Hovering over an area shows the cuisine in that specific country.

Clicking on the country generates a list of all the recipies listed from that cuisine.

## **What's next for InFuse:**
In the future, we hope to add more countries and cuisines to our map. Additionally, we want to provide more recipes when you click on each country and incorporate photos of the delicious dishes.
