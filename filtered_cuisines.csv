Poach until the salmon turns opaque, and is firm to the touch; or to an internal temperature of 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Proceed making the Hollandaise sauce while the salmon is poaching.

Pour a few inches of water into a saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat, then turn heat to medium-high and maintain water at a gentle boil. Place the egg yolks in a metal bowl, and whisk in hot water. Place the bowl over, but not touching, the boiling water. Whisk constantly until the yolks thicken, turn a light, opaque yellow, and double in volume. You may need to remove the bowl from the boiling water from time to time in order to keep from scrambling the yolks.

When the yolks have thickened and increased in volume, begin whisking in the butter, a cube at a time until it melts and incorporates into the hollandaise sauce. Wait for each cube to melt and incorporate before adding the next. Once all of the butter has been incorporated, remove from heat, whisk in the lemon juice, and season to taste with salt and pepper.

To serve, drain the poached salmon and place each piece onto a dinner plate. Generously ladle with the warm hollandaise sauce, and sprinkle with chives.

Quince Paste,300,1 9x13x1 1/2-inch thick block,4 Â½ pounds ripe quinces,"Wash, peel, and core the quinces, reserving the cores and peels. Coarsely chop the flesh and transfer the fruit to a large pan. Wrap the cores and peels in cheesecloth, tie the bag with kitchen string, and add it to the pan. (The peels contain most of the fruit's pectin, which contributes to the firmness of the quince paste.)

Pour in enough water to cover the quinces and boil, half-covered, for 30 to 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft. Remove the bag of peels and pass the quince flesh through a sieve or food mill. (For best results, don't use a food processor as it will result in too fine a texture.) You should have about 2 1/2 pounds of fruit pulp.

Transfer the quince pulp to a saucepan and add the sugar (ideally, you should add the same amount of sugar, by weight, as the fruit pulp). Cook and stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the paste becomes very thick and has a deep orange color. Draw the wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan: it should leave a trail and the quince mixture will stick to the spoon.

Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or line it with greased parchment paper. Transfer the quince paste to the baking dish, spreading it about 1 1/2-inch thick. Smooth the top and allow it to cool.

Dry the paste on your lowest oven setting, no more than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), for about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the quince paste to cool completely before slicing. (In Europe, the traditional method of drying the quince paste is to leave it in a cupboard for about 7 days. The remaining juices will continue to evaporate and render a drier paste.)

Store quince paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator; the color will deepen with age.

Once the dough has doubled, punch down and knead a bit - a lot if you want. The dough should be elastic. Cover and allow to rise again. If you like, you may refrigerate overnight. My grandmother would let it rise overnight, and hers were amazing. When the dough has doubled, it is ready to use.

Heat oil in a deep fryer or large deep skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Set a small dish of water to the side for wetting your hands slightly before touching the dough. This will help it keep from sticking. Only wet your hands a little, excess water dripping in the hot oil is very dangerous.

With slightly wet hands, gather a small ball of dough about the size of a golf ball. Stretch the dough out a little bit while turning around until you have a disc about 4 inches wide. If you mess up, just throw it back in with the other dough, and start over. Tiny holes are fine.

Quince Paste,300,1 9x13x1 1/2-inch thick block,4 Â½ pounds ripe quinces,"Wash, peel, and core the quinces, reserving the cores and peels. Coarsely chop the flesh and transfer the fruit to a large pan. Wrap the cores and peels in cheesecloth, tie the bag with kitchen string, and add it to the pan. (The peels contain most of the fruit's pectin, which contributes to the firmness of the quince paste.)

Pour in enough water to cover the quinces and boil, half-covered, for 30 to 40 minutes or until the fruit is very soft. Remove the bag of peels and pass the quince flesh through a sieve or food mill. (For best results, don't use a food processor as it will result in too fine a texture.) You should have about 2 1/2 pounds of fruit pulp.

Transfer the quince pulp to a saucepan and add the sugar (ideally, you should add the same amount of sugar, by weight, as the fruit pulp). Cook and stir over low heat until the sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring frequently with a wooden spoon, until the paste becomes very thick and has a deep orange color. Draw the wooden spoon along the bottom of the saucepan: it should leave a trail and the quince mixture will stick to the spoon.

Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish or line it with greased parchment paper. Transfer the quince paste to the baking dish, spreading it about 1 1/2-inch thick. Smooth the top and allow it to cool.

Dry the paste on your lowest oven setting, no more than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), for about 1 1/2 hours. Allow the quince paste to cool completely before slicing. (In Europe, the traditional method of drying the quince paste is to leave it in a cupboard for about 7 days. The remaining juices will continue to evaporate and render a drier paste.)

Store quince paste in an airtight container in the refrigerator; the color will deepen with age.

Let the cake cool in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes, remove the side of the pan, and invert the cake onto another rack. Remove the bottom of the pan, invert the torte onto a rack, and let it cool completely. (The cake will fall as it cools.)

To Make Glaze: Put 6 ounces of the finely chopped chocolate in a small bowl, in a saucepan bring 1/2 cup of the cream to a boil, and pour it over the chocolate. Stir the mixture until the chocolate is melted and the glaze is smooth and stir in 1 tablespoon of the rum. Dip each candied chestnut halfway into the glaze to coat it partially, transfer the chestnuts to a foil-covered tray, and let them set.

Invert the cake onto a rack set on wax paper, pour the glaze over it, smoothing the glaze with a spatula and letting the excess drip down the side, and let the cake stand for 2 hours, or until the glaze is set. Transfer the cake carefully to a serving plate and garnish it with the coated chestnuts.

Make the whipped cream just before serving the cake: In a chilled bowl with chilled beaters beat the 1 cup heavy cream until it holds soft peaks, beat in the 2 tablespoons sugar and the1 tablespoon  rum, and beat the mixture until it holds stiff peaks. Fold in the chopped candied chestnuts. Serve the cake with the whipped cream.

Punch dough down. Turn dough out onto a large, lightly floured surface, cover with the bowl, and let rest 10 minutes. Line three 9x5-inch loaf pans with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on long sides.

Divide dough into thirds; roll each third out to a 12-inch square on a lightly floured surface. Spoon 1/3 of the walnut filling onto each dough square and spread to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Roll up each square tightly as for a jelly roll. Pinch ends and seams closed to seal. With your palms, roll logs back and forth until uniformly round.

With a sharp knife or dough scraper, cut 1 log in half lengthwise to form 2 striped strands. Working quickly, twist strands loosely together with cut sides facing out, making 2 or 3 wide, horizontal twists. Fit into one of the prepared pans, patting back any loose filling and tucking ends under, if needed. It might look like a mess now, but it comes out beautifully!

"Bruschetta With Pesto, Tomatoes and Thingies.",30,,"1 baguette, fresh, long","(I find it best to slice up the entire baguette (long French loaf) because if you use only what you need, the rest of the loaf goes stale. Bake the bread, cool the slices you don't use, and keep in a plastic bag to use again -- can be heated up again).
Heat oven to 400 deg F/200 deg Celsius.
Slice the baguette at a slight diagonal slant.
Pour some fruity virgin olive oil in a bowl, dip each slice just lightly into the oil (one side only). It does not have to be covered in oil -- just ""anointed"": it will have patches the oil didn't reach.
Pack on any cookie tin, and when oven has reached its heat, bake the slices until the edges start to go golden, and the slices are hard in the centre. (Do feel before you remove them!).
While they bake, peel the tomato, cut into 2 halves, and chop up finely. Do the same with the 1/2 onion, and add to the tomato.
Season with salt and black pepper, and trust me, a pure flaky sea salt is better tasting than ordinary kitchen salt.
Use as many baked bread slices as you need -- at least 3 per person. As you add the topping, put them back on the baking tin, or transfer to another, smaller dish -- depending on how many you are making.

Check once or twice to see that the pan liquid is bubbling and the onions are melting (not burning) but don't stir.

Salad: Pour half of dressing over the red onions, lemon and cuke in a LARGE salad bowl and let them absorb the flavor, 15+ minutes.
Add lettuce, tomatoes, scallions and MINT along with the rest of the dressing.
Toss the salad until all ingredients are very well coated and mixed.
Dish Salad onto plates and top with slices of cooked beef, make sure plenty of dressing is included in each serving.
Add a serving of sticky rice to each plate.
Serving Suggestion: Very pretty to serve this salad on a bed of Purple Cabbage Leaves.
Perfect Sticky Rice: Soak 1-2 pounds of Thai Sweet Rice in lukewarm water in a large bowl for 3 hours- drain& reserve water to use in steaming.
Line bottom of bamboo steamer (the stackable sort used for veggies and such) with parchment paper (or cheesecloth sprayed with Pam).
Fill steamer with soaked rice and cover.

Place steamer over water in pan, bring water to boil then reduce to strong simmer-- don't let water cook away.
Steam rice for approx 25 minutes, let sit an additional 5 minutes with lid on.
To Make Toasted Rice Powder: Toast raw sweet rice in a saute pan on top of stove just as you would sesame seeds-- until very light golden brown.
Use a coffee grinder, blender or food processor to grind to a fine consistency- I like mine fine as white sugar but any testure from cous cous, cornmeal, flour, etc is just fine.

Make sure to stir at least once every 10 minutes, for about 60 minutes. Don't be afraid to add extra water if the water levels are looking low.  It is much better to add more than to let the tapiocas run dry and stick to the pan.

When the tapioca pearls are cooled down, pack in water and store until eating.

Mama Roy's Daughter's Chicken Curry,70,6 serving(s),3 small onions (size of your palm),"1) Peel and cut up onions into 6-8 pieces each (something that will fit into a food processor or a blender). Peel garlic and ginger.
2)Put onions, garlic, and ginger into food processor or blender with a spoon of water. Blend/grate into a rough paste. Does not need to be super smooth.
3) Prep the chicken - take skins off if you bought chicken with the skin on. Rinse the chicken with water and pat dry. Create slits in the pieces randomly with a knife so that the spices can get into the meat.
4) Take about 4 spoons of the onion, garlic, ginger paste and the spices (Indian chili powder, turmeric, cumin) and coat the chicken with it all.  Add the salt as well. NOTE RE SPICES: we never measure these spices, but ratios help. For this part of the recipe, smaller amounts of each chili powder, cumin, and turmeric are fine - let's say one spoon of each, more of the chili powder if you want it spicy.
5) Place a 6-8 quart pot on medium-high heat. Add a turn or two of canola oil, enough to evenly coat the bottom of the pot. When the oil is heated through, add cloves, cardamom (try to open them up a bit), and cinnamon bark. Stir the whole spices around a little until fragrant.
6) Once you start smelling the whole spices, add the rest of your onion/garlic/ginger paste. Cook until the paste starts to take on a slightly reddish color. Add larger amounts of the spices now. I will do two generous shakes of the chili powder (I like my curries spicy), one shake of ground cumin, and one shake of turmeric. If it looks too brown, I will add some turmeric and chili powder because I want it to be a little brighter.
7) Add the chicken after the paste and spices incorporate. Stir frequently so the chicken does not stick to the pot. Once all the chicken turns opaque on the outside, cover with a lid, lower the heat to medium and let everything cook together for about 20 minutes.
8) After 20 minutes, check the pot to see if any liquid has come out. This is the curry! If it looks dry, add some a couple cups of hot water to the pot, but only if it looks totally dry. Stir the chicken and recover the pot, lower the heat a little more, and let it all simmer/stew together for another 20 minutes.
9) 15 minutes into the second 20 minutes, add the Thai chilies. Make sure they are washed. If you want more of the heat to come out of the chilies, make one diagonal slit in each chili. Adding the chilies is optional.
10) At the end of the 20 minutes, check your pot. There should be ample curry. Give it all a final stir and check the chicken to make sure it is all cooked through. It should be by now, but you can never be too careful! Have some cooked rice handy and serve with some saag bhaji (another recipe!). This recipe is easy to scale up or down and if you have leftovers, you can eat this up to 4 days after you make it, at least.",indian,IND

Papadams,55,12 serving(s),2 cups gram flour (chickpea flour),"Stir together the flour, pepper, ground cumin seed, and salt in a large bowl or in the food processor; mix thoroughly until the spices are evenly distributed.
Add the garlic and mix well.
Add enough of the water to form a dough that will hold together in a cohesive ball; if necessary, add up to 1 additional tablespoon water.
The dough should be fairly stiff and dry; if it is too wet, it will not roll well.
Knead the dough for about 5 minutes by hand or pulse for about 15 seconds in the food processor; the dough should be smooth.
With your hands, shape the dough into a cylinder or log about 2 inches thick and 6 inches long.
With a sharp knife, cut the cylinder into 1/2-inch thick slices.
The next step uses oil, so do not use your pastry cloth and rolling pin sleeve.
Place each slice on a lightly oiled surface.
Lightly oil the top of the slice and then roll out into a very thin circle about 6 or 7 inches in diameter.
Papadams must be rolled extremely thin, maximum 1/16 inch.
If the dough sticks to your rolling pin, gently pull it off.
Dust the tops of each papadam with cayenne pepper.
Using a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the papadams from the rolling surface, carefully place them on large baking sheets.
The traditional method for preparing and frying papadams is described below; you can also bake them in a 300F oven for about 15 to 25 minutes, or until crisp and dry.
The cooking time may vary beyond this range depending upon the thickness and moisture in the rolled dough.
Cool them on a rack.
To prepare the papadams in an authentic manner, don't bake them; first allow them to dry by leaving them in the sun for a few hours or by placing them in a very low oven (less than 200F) for 1 to 2 hours, turning occasionally.
Dry the papadams until they are just slightly flexible and show no moisture; they should not brown or bake, however.
At this point, the papadams may be stacked flat and stored in an airtight container until needed; they will keep for months if stored properly.
When ready to serve, heat about 1/8 inch of oil in a large skillet; the oil should be hot, but not smoking; a drop of water flicked into the skillet should sizzle immediately.
One at a time, drop the papadams into the hot oil.
Turn the papadam when it begins to curl at the edges; it will quickly fry and become crisp.
Remove it before it turns brown.
Cool and drain the papadams on paper towels and eat them immediately.",indian,IND

When you are ready to cook, take the chicken out of the refrigerator, line a large roasting pan with foil, lay a rack over the pan so air can circulate under the roasting chicken, and pre-heat your oven to 425.  If you have a convection bake or convection roast cycle, use that.
Place the chicken pieces on the rack so they are not touching.  Empty what is left of the marinade into a bowl or measuring cup and touch up any ""empty"" spots on the chicken pieces with the marinade.
Once the oven is hot, put the pan with the chicken in the oven, and leave the door closed (no peeking!).  Turn the chicken pieces once after 30 minutes of cooking time, then roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly charred on the second side, but no more than 15 minutes for legs and thighs.  If you are cooking breasts, poke one with a skewer to make sure the juices run clear.
NOW TURN THE OVEN OFF, and let the chicken rest in the closed oven for 20-30 minutes more (not critical, but NO PEEKING!).
Remove the chicken to a warm platter, garnish with the onion rings and a few squeezes of lemon, and enjoy!
See if you don't agree this is as good as any ""authentic"" Tandoori chicken you've ever tried!",indian,IND
Gulab Jamun,50,,Traditional Method,"To Make Ghee: Put the butter in a good saucepan and bring to a boil on medium heat. Then reduce to low. Now this is what will happen as the butter slowly simmers. Moisture will be evaporated out of the ghee. The white protein-solids from the butter will sink down to the bottom of the pan and slowly turn golden. A foam will rise to the surface, and as it cooks will form a bit of a crust. The butter will cook into a gold color as well, and it will have a slightly nutty smell. When the moisture is gone, the ghee is done. Decant the oil and save the delicious golden buttery bits on the bottom of the pan for toast, or mixed with veggies or potatoes. If you've used salted butter, you don't want to use it on toast- the salt will knock you out, but it's still good in potatoes or whatnot.
Making the Scented Syrup: Combine sugar and water and bring to a boil for 3 minutes. Remove from heat and add rose water or essence.
Traditional Method: Use a heavy-bottomed pan because the milk will stick. Use a non-stick pot if you have it. Boil the milk down over medium heat, while stirring,  until it forms a paste.  Add the flour and mix into a smooth paste. Oil your hands and roll them into uniform balls, place them onto a buttered plate and set aside.
Powdered-Milk Method: Combine the warm milk and ghee together. Mix the powdered milk and flour together and sprinkle slowly into the wet mix to form a dough. Oil your hands and form uniform balls (about 24) and set aside on a buttered plate.
Cooking the jamuns:
This is the most delicate part of the operation. Gentle, low heat is a must. Use a wok or karai for best results, with the ghee about 2.5-3 inches in depth.
Heat the ghee on low to 215 degrees.
Slip in the balls, one by one. They will sink. No touching at this point.
Gently shake the pan to move the balls and keep them from getting too brown on one side. After about 5 minutes they will begin to float. You will notice them getting bigger.
Now, use a wooden spoon or equivalent to gently agitate and keep them evenly browning.
The ghee will slowly get hotter as the balls cook.
After about 20 minutes, the ghee will have risen in temperature to around 245 degrees and the balls should be nice and golden.
Remove a ball and put it in the syrup. If it doesn't collapse after 3 minutes, remove the others and add to the syrup.
If it does collapse, fry for another 5 minutes and try again.
Let soak for 2 hours at least before serving.
Serve room temperature or warmed up.
Enjoy your gulab jamuns!",indian,IND
Chapati (Indian Flat Bread),166,,2 cups whole wheat flour,"In a large mixing bowl stir together the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, and the salt. Add 3/4 cup of the warm water while mixing constantly with your hands till the dough is moist.  Add the remaining water, 1 tbsp at a time, mixing constantly with your hands.  Keep working the dough till the dough forms a ball and holds its shape. (The dough will be stiff).
Dampen your hands.  Keep the dough in the mixing bowl to knead.  Knead in an additional 2 tbsp all-purpose flour, if necessary, to make a moderately stiff dough.  Knead dough till smooth and elastic (8 to 10 minutes). Continue dampening hands, as needed, during kneading.  The dough is ready for shaping when you can lightly and quickly press two fingertips 1/4 inch into the dough and the dough springs back.
Shape the dough into a ball.  Cover the bowl with a damp towel.  Let the dough stand in a warm place for 30 to 60 minutes.
Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.  Knead dough 1 to 2 minutes more.  Divide the dough in half.  Form each half into a 12 inch long roll.  Cut each roll into 12 one-inch pieces.  Flatten each piece of dough with the palm of the hand.
Sprinkle some flour over the flattened balls.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Let rest for 30 minutes.
On a well floured surface roll the flattened ball into a circle 7 to 8 inches in diameter, turning the dough over once and firmly pressing and stretching the dough with the rolling pin.
Roll around the rolling pin, and transfer to a hot, greased griddle or heavy skillet.  Cook over medium heat about 1/2 to 1 minute or until tiny brown spots appear.  Using tongs, turn and cook 30 seconds more.  Remove from heat; Brush with Usli Ghee or melted shortening.  Repeat with the remaining balls.

Delicious Homemade Instant Jalebis!,45,,1 cup all-purpose flour (known as 'maida' in Hindi),"Put flour in a mixing bowl.
Add gramflour.
Mix well.
Add yogurt and water.
Mix well, using a spoon, ensuring that no lumps remain.
Mix to obtain what is technically called,""ribbon consistency"".
(Ribbon consistency simply requires you to mix for about 5-7 minutes, really well, so that when the mixture is dropped from the mixing spoon into the mixing bowl, it should fall like a ribbon. Don't let the term scare you, it's pretty easy, you just got to).
Add a pinch of baking soda.
At this point, this mixture (batter) can be refrigerated if you are planning on making the jalebis later.
If you plan to make the jalebis instantly, put the mixture in a jalebi bottle (you get these bottles to make jalebis in the market).
If you dont have a jalebi bottle, you can use an empty well-washed and thoroughly clean, tomato ketchup bottle.
If you got an icing bag, use that.
I used the icing bag with the""star"" nozzle attachment.
You may experiment with the other nozzles, if you wish, but please dont, in any circumstances, try using the""writing"" nozzle attachment, because if you do so, the jalebis that you'll be making will be the thinnest on the face of the planet,lol.
Heat oil on low-medium flame in a frying pan.
Meanwhile, spoon the above prepared batter in the icing bag fitted with the star nozzle/jalebi bottle/ tomato ketchup bottle.
Drop the batter by squeezing the bottle/icing bag, into the hot oil, in concentric circular motion to make the jalebis.
Lightly brown on either side.
Repeat until all the batter is used up.
On low flame heat the pre-prepared sugar-water syrup (known in Hindi as""chashni"").
Add few threads of saffron to the syrup- these look really pretty on the jalebis later when you dip the latter into them.
Now, drain the excess oil from the jalebis.
Drop into the sugar-water syrup.
Dip well, toss well, to coat the jalebis in the syrup.
Drain excess syrup from the jalebis.
Serve immediately or serve hot if you plan to serve them later on, make sure to warm them a bit in the oven (2-3 minutes) and then serve.
Get ready to put on your apron and go make more of these because they'll vanish before you know!

Chappatis (Roti),120,,6 cups all-purpose flour,"Put flour and salt in a bowl.
Add water a cup at a time, kneading.
When kneading, make your hand into a fist and roll your knuckles into the dough, folding edges in continuously, working in all the flour.
When all the flour is kneaded into a ball, poke lots of holes into the ball of dough.
Pour a little oil into the dough and knead it inches.
Add the rest of the oil (the dough will look very oily and that's the way it should be).
Cover with a clean cloth and let sit for at least an hour.
Roll the ball in a little bit of flour so it's not sticky.
Divide the dough into about 15-20 balls depending on how big you want the chappatis to be.
Flour the counter/board.
Roll out each ball to about 6 inches in diameter.
Brush with melted butter.
Fold in three (like you fold a letter).
Now it should almost look like a long tube.
Take one end of that tube and fold it in to the centre and gently press it inches.
Take the other end of the tube and fold it over the seam.

Puran Poli,60,8 serving(s),"3 cups stone-ground durum whole wheat flour, sifted, plus extra for dredging","Method: Filling.
Warm two tablespoons of ghee in a nonstick saucepan. As it melts, add the cooked pigeon peas, and stir until the water evaporates and the mixture thickens. Continually scrape the sides of the saucepan to ensure even distribution of heat or else the daal will burn. Add half the sugar and stir it in well. Adjust to desired sweetness. Reduce the heat and continue to thicken until the mashed pigeon peas resemble mashed potatoes. Add the crushed cardamom powder, saffron and nutmeg, stir well and portion into eight pieces. This filling can be made up to 3 days in advance, and stored in the fridge until ready to use. Bring it to room temperature to ease the rolling process.
Method: Dough.
Using a food processor fitted with an S blade or in a large bowl, combine the flour with salt and enough water to make a firm dough. The dough should be firm but not hard, moist but not wet, and similar in consistency of modeling clay. Carefully knead the oil into the dough and cover with a clear wrap or lid until ready to roll.
Method: Rolling & Cooking.
Start by rolling out a single ball of dough into a flat disk, as one would begin a paratha, no more than 5â diameter. Place the mashed sweetened pigeon peas mash, puran, in the center, pinch the dough and fold over the ball to cover the ball completely, like a dumpling. Ensure the seams are sealed. Lightly flatten this in the palm of your hand. Dredge the ball in dry flour and begin to roll again, this time very lightly to ensure the filling does not spill out. Roll to make an 8â poli using dry flour to dust as needed. When sufficiently rolled, dust off excess flour.
Heat a shallow nonstick pan on medium-high heat. When ready to place a Puran poli in the pan, turn it down to medium heat. The side that hits the pan first is the first side. Watch the dough bubble slightly and move it around in the pan without flipping it over. Turn the Puran poli over approximately 1 minute later. The first side should be lightly spotted but not have dark spots. If this happens too quickly, reduce the heat. Repeat on the second side, and while the second side cooks, lightly baste the first side of the with ghee. Using a spatula, flip the paratha and repeat the basting. Both sides should have gheeâcooked once without ghee and once with ghee. Remove from heat and cover with a paper towel or a colander to help the steam evaporate. Once they have come to room temperature, the Puran Poli can be transferred to an appropriate storage container.",indian,IND

Pat the fish dry with paper towels. Check the thickness of the batter by dipping in one piece of the fish. The batter should be the consistency of medium-thick pancake batter, coating the fish easily but dripping very little. Add a little beer if the batter seems too thick.
Add the fish to the batter. Using tongs or chopsticks, swish each piece to make sure it is thoroughly coated, then lift out of the batter, let it drip once, and lay the fish gently into the hot oil. Cook a few pieces at a time until they float and the batter is set but still very light in color. If a piece sticks to the bottom, leave it alone and it will release itself.
Remove the fish to a rack to drain; reserve the frying oil. (The fish can be prepared ahead to this point, cooled on a rack, and refrigerated uncovered. Cool the oil and reserve).
When you are ready to serve, reheat the oil to 350-360Â°F and refry the fish a few pieces at a time until crisp and golden brown.

Tamales De Pollo Con Chile Verde- Green Chile Chicken Tamales,150,,1 (8 ounce) package dried corn husks,"Preparing the cornhusks. Cover the husks with very hot water, weight with a plate to keep them submerged, and let stand for a couple of hours until the husks are pliable.
Preparing the filling: On a baking sheet, roast the tomatillos about 4 inches below a very hot broiler until soft (theyâll blacken in spots), about 5 minutes; flip them over and roast the other side. Cool and transfer to a food processor or blender, along with all the delicious juice that has run onto the baking sheet. Add the chiles and garlic and process to a smooth puree. Heat the oil in a medium-size saucepan over medium high. When quite hot, add the puree all at once and stir until noticeably thicker and darker, about 5 minutes.(I cover the pot with a splatter screen)  Add 2 cups of the broth and simmer over medium heat (I use high heat)  until thick enough to coat a spoon quite heavily, at least 10 minutes. I keep it simmering while I shred the chicken. (If you are making a double batch of the recipe, make sure to cook the filling for a longer amount of time.) Taste and season highly with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. Stir in the chicken and cilantro; cool completely.
Preparing the batter: With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the lard or shortening with 2 teaspoons salt and the baking powder until light in texture, about 1 minute. Continue beating as you add the masa (fresh or reconstituted) in three additions. Reduce the speed to medium-low and add 1 cup of the remaining broth. Continue beating for another minute or so, until a Â½-teaspoon dollop of the batter floats in a cup of cold water (if it floats you can be sure the tamales will be tender and light). Beat in enough of the remaining Â½ cup of broth to give the mixture the consistency of soft (not runny) cake batter; it should hold its shape in a spoon. Taste the batter and season with additional salt if you think it needs some. For the lightest textured tamales, refrigerate the batter for an hour or so, then rebeat, adding a little more broth or water to bring the mixture to the soft consistency it had before.
For forming the tamales, separate out 24 of the largest and most pliable husksâones that are at least 6 inches across on the wider end and 6 or 7 inches long. If you canât find enough good ones, overlap some of the large ones to give wide, sturdy surfaces to spread the batter on. Pat the chosen husks dry with a towel.
Forming the tamales. Cut twenty-four 8- to 10-inch pieces of string or thin strips of cornhusks. One at a time, form the tamales: Lay out one of your chosen cornhusks with the tapering end toward you. Spread about Â¼ cup of the batter into about a 4-inch square, leaving at least a 1 Â½-inch border on the side toward you and a Â¾-inch border along the other sides (with large husks, the borders will be much bigger). Spoon about 1 Â½ tablespoons of the filling down the center of the batter. Pick up the two long sides of the cornhusk and bring them together (this will cause the batter to surround the filling). If the uncovered borders of the two long sides youâre holding are narrow, tuck one side under the other; if wide, roll both sides in the same direction around the tamal. (If the husk is small, you may feel more comfortable wrapping the tamal in a second husk.) Finally, fold up the empty 1 Â½-inch section of the husk (to form a tightly closed âbottomâ leaving the top open), and secure it in place by loosely tying one of the strings or strips of husk around the tamal. As theyâre made, stand the tamales on their folded bottoms in the prepared steamer. Donât tie the tamales too tightly or pack them too closely in the steamer. They need room to expand.
Setting up the steamer. Steaming 24 husk-wrapped tamales can be done in batches in a collapsible vegetable steamer set into a large, deep saucepan. To steam them all at once, you need something like the kettle-size tamal steamers used in Mexico or Asian stack steamers, or you can improvise by setting a wire rack on 4 coffee or custard cups in a large kettle. It is best to line the rack or upper part of the steamer with leftover cornhusks to protect the tamales from direct contact with the steam and to add more flavor. Make sure to leave tiny spaces between the husks so condensing steam can drain off.
Steaming and serving the tamales: When all the tamales are in the steamer, cover them with a layer of leftover cornhusks; if your husk-wrapped tamales donât take up the entire steamer, fill in the open spaces with loosely wadded aluminum foil (to keep the tamales from falling over). Set the lid in place and steam over a constant medium heat for about 1 Â¼ hours. (depending on the size of the tamales you make, it can take up to 4 hours). Watch carefully that all the water doesnât boil away and, to keep the steam steady, pour boiling water into the pot when more is necessary. Tamales are done when the husk peels away from the masa easily. Let tamales stand in the steamer off the heat for a few minutes to firm up. For the best textured tamales, let them cool completely, then re-steam about 15 minutes to heat through.",mexican,MEX

The Mexican chocolate clam, so-called for its brown-colored shell, is the largest West Coast bivalve. Reaching up to 6 inches across, the clams are very popular all along the coast of Central America. If Mexican chocolate clams are unavailable at your local store, you can use any other high-quality clams (still in their shells).",mexican,MEX

PREPARE THE MARINADE/GLAZE: Heat a griddle or large cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Tear chiles into flat pieces and toast a few at a time, pressing them against the hot surface, until they crack and blister; flip them and press down again. Transfer chiles to a large bowl and cover with boiling water; weight down with a plate to keep them submerged, and soak at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, roast the garlic in the same griddle or skillet, turning frequently, until soft inside and blackened outside, about 15 minutes. Cool and peel. Drain chiles, reserving 3/4 cup soaking liquid; put chiles into a blender with garlic, cloves, sesame seeds, vinegar, cumin, peppercorns or ground pepper, and salt. Process/blend until mixture is smooth; then strain through a medium-mesh sieve into a bowl. Remove 1/2 cup of mixture to a small bowl, and stir in the sugar; set aside to use for the final glazing.
MARINATE THE MEAT: Spread the rest of the chile paste thoroughly over the meat. Cover completely and refrigerate at least 18 hours.
COOK (SLOW-STEAM) THE MEAT: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Use a deep wide roasting pan that has a tight lid. Put a roasting rack into the bottom of the pan (it must sit at least 1 inch above the bottom of the pan---if not, prop it up with custard cups, tin cans, etc.) Measure in 4 cups of water. Then lay the marinated meat onto the rack and spread any marinade remaining in the marinating pan or dish. Cut a double thickness of heavy-duty foil to cover the roasting pan; place the pan lid over, making sure the pan is covered as tightly as possible. Bake 4 hours.
FINISHING THE BROTH: Remove the pan lid and foil; carefully remove the tender meat to a platter. Take out the rack; spoon the fat off the broth with a ladle. Measure out the broth into a 1-quart container; add water to equal 1 quart liquid if necessary, and pour into a saucepan. Puree the tomato in a blender and add it to the broth along with the oregano and cinnamon. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat 45 minutes. Season with salt.
GLAZE THE MEAT: Heat oven to 375 degrees. Remove meat from the bones, keeping pieces of meat as large as possible; discard bones, gristle and excess fat. Set meat on a baking sheet; brush lightly with reserved chile paste glaze, and bake 10 minutes to set the glaze.
TO SERVE: Keep tortillas warm in a towel-covered basket. Serve the broth in a tureen. Present the meat on a large platter, or slice meat across the grain to serve it in deep plates, awash in the broth. Combine onion and coriander in a small bowl to pass with the lime at the table.",mexican,MEX

Mix the Tahini thoroughly before measuring. It separates easily and the thicker part at the bottom needs to be mixed in before pouring to measure.
Bring 1 c of water to a boil.
At the same time, start the Tahini on low in a sauce pan. Stir in the vanilla. Continue to  heat, while occasionally stirring, until it reaches about 50Â°C (120Â°F). Do not heat it up too quickly or go over temp, because it will scorch. Remove from heat when it reaches temperature.
Once the water is boiling, pour it over the sugar in a larger pan and stir until dissolved.
Over high heat, bring the sugar water to a boil until it reaches 121Â°C (not over 250Â°F). Use a candy thermometer.
As you're waiting for the sugar water to get to temp, the tahini should reach the proper temperature.
Pour it into the bowl of a stand mixer with the mixing paddle attached.
When the sugar water reaches the proper temp, immediately turn the heat off, and start the stand mixer on low while pouring in the sugar water until combined. Be careful it is scorching hot!
Bump the speed up to 3 and watch carefully as it mixes. It won't take longer than about 30 seconds to get to the proper consistency. When you see the mixture starting to pull away from the side of the bowl, stop mixing immediately, and pour the mixture into your prepared pan.
It will begin to stiffen as you are pouring it into the pan, so be quick about scraping the remains out of the bowl. With a flat scraper or back of a wide wooden spoon, press the mixture into a level layer.
Let cool for about a half an hour at room temp, then remove solidified piece from pan and cut into 36 pieces (6 rows and 6 columns).

Pistachio-Crusted Moroccan Rack of Lamb With Israeli Couscous,60,3 serving(s),1 rack of lamb,"Rinse rack of lamb under cold water and pat dry. Using a sharp knife, cut a few slits between the bones and into the meat. (This will allow some of the spice blend to penetrate into the meat)  Brush with olive oil. Sprinkle with Ras el hanout and paprika. Allow to stand at room temperature while preparing the couscous.
Rinse cilantro, parsley, and mint leaves. (Amounts listed above in ingredients are approximate, since I use a handful of each) Dry in paper towels, then roughly chop. Also roughly chop preserved lemon and dried apricot. **For most recipes that call for preserved lemon, thoroughly rinse off the salt and remove the pulp and seeds, using only the rind.** If you do not have preserved lemon, zest a whole lemon to add later while combining couscous ingredients.
Grind pistachio nuts and combine with bread crumbs. (If your pistachios are salted, there is no need to add salt to the lamb before searing it).
To prepare the Israeli couscous, melt butter in saucepan and sautÃ© chopped onion until soft. Add the couscous and cook with the sautÃ©ed onion, then add the stock. If you do not have stock, use water. Bring to boil, then reduce heat. Cover and continue simmering about 8 minutes, until couscous is soft. Not all of the liquid will be absorbed. Empty contents into a fine-mesh strainer and rinse with cold water, rinsing off the starch that was released during simmering. Return the rinsed and drained couscous back into the saucepan and reheat slightly.
Prepare your lamb:  Preheat oven to 375.  If your pistachio nuts are unsalted, sprinkle rack of lamb with salt.  Using an oven-proof skillet, heat olive oil over moderately high heat. When oil is hot, sear the lamb rack until browned, about 5 minutes per side.
Remove pan from heat. Slather both sides of lamb rack with pomegranate molasses. Then with meaty side of lamb rack up, pack nut crumb mixture on top.  Place skillet in oven and roast until internal temp reaches 140 degrees F for rare, about 15-20 minutes.  Then allow to stand a few minutes before carving.
Combine couscous, preserved lemon or zest, apricot, pomegranate seeds, and chopped mint, cilantro, and parsley.  If desired toss couscous with a splash of olive oil and a small amount of lemon juice from the zested lemon.
Carve rack into 8 chops.  Spoon couscous onto plate and arrange chops on top.
************************************************************************************************.
Preserved lemon:  You will need a glass jar with an air-tight seal.  Combine ~ a tablespoon of coriander seed with ~ a tablespoon of fennel seed.  Place 1 bay leaf and 1 cinnamon stick in the bottom of glass jar. Have a small bowl of Kosher salt nearby. Slice lemons in quarters ALMOST down to stem end, but leave intact.  Place coriander and fennel seed inside lemon and also fill with salt.  Place cut side down into glass jar, squeezing as many into the jar as you can.  As you squeeze them, some of the lemon juice is released, but not enough to fill the jar.  Just continue packing in as many lemons as you can and add additional salt between layers of lemon.  Top off with freshly squeezed lemon juice.  Then refrigerate for a month. I think this is Jamie Oliver's technique, but there are many out there.  He has also suggested doing this with other citrus, like limes and mandarin oranges. Meyer lemons work nicely.  Some techniques suggest a layer of olive oil on top, and this works well, too.",israeli,ISR

Kimchi or Kimchee,165,50 serving(s),4 heads napa cabbage,"Cut cabbage into four sections through the core.
Starting at the end of the leaves, cut cabbage diagonally back and forth until you reach the core.  (Cabbage will be in large square pieces).
Cut radish into large chunks (if you want to be able to use them independently) or into julienne strips.
Layer cabbage and radish in your sink with the salt.  Put about 1/2 cup salt for every two inches of cabbage.  Make sure you end with salt.
Add water to almost cover cabbage.
Let stand.  After 1 1/2 hours start checking the cabbage by rubbing a piece between your fingers.  If it's slippery, rinse it and taste it.  If it's pleasantly salty then it's ready.  Be sure not to let the cabbage stand too long or it will become too salty and will be inedible.
Fill the sink with water until it covers the cabbage then fish the cabbage out of the sink.  Return the cabbage to the sink and rinse it this way two or three times until all the cabbage is thoroughly rinsed.
Drain cabbage by placing it in large colander or by letting it sit in your unstopped sink.
Make the pul by mixing the rice flour and water in a small sauce pan and heating to boiling, stirring constantly.  Let cool.  If you don't have rice flour you can add water to cooked rice and boil it until the water is very cloudy.  Use one cup of this water.
Mix pul and remaining ingredients in very large bowl.  The amount of red pepper you use should depend on how hot you want your kim chee.  There are many kinds of fish sauce.  The one cup measurement is for a thin sauce (consistency like soy sauce).  For thicker sauces, use less sauce (1/4 to 1/2 cup).
Wearing plastic or rubber gloves, begin mixing the cabbage with the sauce.  Use your hands and mix a little cabbage at a time then push it to the side of the bowl until you have mixed all the cabbage.  This will help you mix the cabbage and sauce evenly.
Place kim chee in large containers that have tight fitting lids (otherwise it will smell up your fridge).
You can eat the kim chee immediately, but most Korean women recommend that you leave it outside of the fridge for one day, then store it in the fridge but wait one week after that before you eat it.  I can't tell you what the difference is because my husband doesn't wait that long.

Set aside a small portion of the chopped scallions for garnish and add remainder to the marinade.
Set meat onto a cutting board- it is usually an almost rectangular shape, with two shorter sides and two longer sides- position the meat so the""longer"" sides are on the top and bottom, and the""short"" sides are left and right.
Take note of the sinewy lines running straight along the""long"" side of the meat- those are the grain lines.
Take a large chef's knife and cut a very, very thin slice of meat off of the short end, as you do so you should be cutting through the grain lines (top to bottom) as if you were making a line through a grid or a tic-tac toe board- this should result in thin, short strips of meat (cutting through the sinewy lines this way will produce tender meat). Cut all of the meat into these thin, short strips and add them all to the marinade.
Take a vegetable peeler and peel carrots (discard peels)- then using the veggie peeler, continue to""peel"" off strips of the carrot meat until the carrots are all cut into long, wide thin strips- add to marinade and seal container and flip over a few times to make sure everything is coated.
Let marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
Drain meat& carrot strips,reserving the marinade into a small saucepan (don't worry is some of the green onions end up in the meat or the marinade- they will all get cooked eventually).
Heat 1 tsp sesame oil in a large wok or large, deep skillet over medium-high heat.
Stir fry half of the meat strips until just cooked through (maybe 5 minutes or so)- there may still be a little pink remaining- immediately remove to a covered dish to keep warm, then stir fry remaining beef (about another 5 minutes or so) and remove it to the same covered dish.
(Don't try to cook this all together or you will steam the meat and it will get too watery).
Add the marinade to the empty pan and bring to a boil,once it boils, let boil rapidly for 3 minutes to reduce sauce and kill off any bacteria.
While it is reducing, portion out 1 cup cooked rice per serving (see TIP below) and divide meat& carrots among each plate.

Black Sesame Seed Ice Cream (Hoogim-Ja Ice Cream),195,8 serving(s),6 tablespoons black sesame seeds,"Put the black sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over medium heat. The moment they begin to pop and release their aroma, remove them from the pan and let cool. Blitz the seeds in a coffee grinder or food processor until finely ground, then place them in a bowl and com bine them with the agave syrup to form a paste.
Heat 1 can of the coconut milk, the sugar and the salt in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved.
In a bowl, slowly whisk the remaining can of coconut milk into the cornstarch, ensuring there are no lumps. Add this to the saucepan, mix everything together, and cook for 4â6 minutes over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture becomes thick. Use a spatula to stir the mixture, making sure the bottom does not burn or become lumpy. When thickened, remove the pan from the heat and transfer the mixture to a large bowl. If there are any lumps, pass the mixture through a sieve into a bowl.
Stir the sesame seed paste into the ice cream mixture until combined. Place parchment paper onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming and leave to cool completely. Refrigerate for 1â2 hours until well chilled. (You can speed this process up by placing the bowl into an ice bath.).
Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Alternatively, pour the mixture into a wide, flat (preferably metal) pan and place in the freezer. After 40 minutes, use a fork to mix and break down the ice crystals. Repeat this process twice more, at 40-minute intervals. You can blitz it all in a food processor at the final stage to make it really smooth. Return it to the pan and leave in the freezer to set fully. Remove 15 minutes before serving to give the ice cream a chance to soften.

In individual plates add some white rice and the black bean & tofu sauce on the side or on top.
Enjoy.
NOTES:
You can substitute ingredients like using sweet oyster sauce or eliminating the salted black beans and also reducing a little of the spicy ingredients for a milder dish.
The photo shows that I used scotch bonnet peppers which are extremely hot, so substitute other types to your liking.
You can use the soft tofu, but it will break down more easily when stirring and also release more liquid as well.
If you add to much stock (1/2 to 3/4 is good) or the softer types of tofu the sauce will become to thinnerÃ¯Â¿Â½ and you will then need to add more of the tapioca starch mixture for a thicker sauce.

First, wash the rice with water, by swishing the water through with your hands or a wooden spoon, and then draining-- some older cookbooks will tell you to rinse thoroughly, but most modern rice says on the package""no talc,"" (that's what they use to polish it), so all you are doing is washing off the surface dust.
Put the rice and measured water into a medium flat-bottomed pot with a tight-fitting lid.
Ideally, you will soak the rice for 15 minutes to 3 hours before starting to cook it, but if you are pressed for time, you can add an extra tablespoon of water and skip the soak.
Cover the pot, turn the heat on high, and bring the rice to a boil (about 4 minutes): you will know it is boiling because you will hear it bubbling and""dancing"" inside the pot.
Do not remove the lid.
Turn the heat to low (if you have an electric stove you may need to switch to another burner) and simmer (about 15 minutes): you will hear the rice burbling a bit.
Do not remove the lid.
When the water is all absorbed, the sound will change to a low hiss.
When you hear the hissing sound, turn the heat up to high again for just 20-30 seconds to help""dry off"" the bottom of the rice.
Do not remove the lid.
Turn off the heat completely (especially if you have an electric stove, remove the pot from the heat altogether) and let the rice stand covered (do not remove the lid!) and steam itself for another 10-20 minutes.
Dampen a wooden spoon or wooden rice paddle.
Now remove the lid!
Toss the rice lightly with the spoon or paddle so that it is fluffed a bit but still clumps enough to be picked up with chopsticks.

Now check the cabbage.  Take a piece of the thick white part and bend it.  It should give, but not be soft.  Salting takes 10-14 hours.  
Next prepare the flour porridge.  Put 3 cups cold water and the 1/2 cup sweet rice flour in a large saucepan over med-high heat.  STIR constantly.  Once it is boiling and has thicken significantly keep stirring and cooking it for 1 more minute.  
Take the flour porridge off the heat and cool completely.  
Once the porridge has cooled completely to room temperature, put the rest of the ingredients in to the large saucepan and combine well.  Stir for a few minutes to draw out the red color of the gochugaru.
Wearing rubber gloves or some other kind of protective glove, pour the sauce mixture over the cabbage and rub it in well.  Not just mix it.  You much rub it so that every piece of cabbage has been coated.  This rubbing will encourage the red color too.  
Taste a small piece of kimchi.  It has not fermented yet, but see if you feel it lacks something.  Whether salt or sugar.  Adjust if you need to.
Place the unfermented cabbage into 2 large kimchi jars with tightfitting tops.  Press down the cabbage leaving space at the top.  This will keep the kimchi juice from overflowing when it ferments.  put a piece of plastic wrap over the top and then screw on the lid.
Place one  jar into the back of your fridge.  You can take this one out and ferment it when the first jar is done. 
Place one jar on the counter on top of a plate with a lip (this catches any possible overflows)  for 1-2 days.  After 1 day, take a piece out and taste to see if you like the level of fermentation.  If not try another piece after 1/2 day or 1 day.  2 days should be the maximum time it takes. Each time you open the jar, press down the cabbage because the bubbles from the fermentation will cause the cabbage to lift out of the liquid. After you are satisfied with the fermentation level, place the jar into the fridge and enjoy. 
After the kimchi has become to soft for you to enjoy eating raw, it is perfect for cooked applications.  Do not throw it away.  This does not rot easily unless you contaminate the jar.",korean,KOR

Notes:
For a quick dinner, prepare the pickles, chile sauce, and vegetables a day ahead (warm the vegetables to room temperature in the microwave before adding them to the rice). You can also substitute storebought kimchi for the pickles to save time. The Korean chile paste gochujang is sold in Asian markets and some supermarkets. If you canât find it, an equal amount of Sriracha can be substituted. But because Sriracha is more watery than gochujang, omit the water from the chile sauce and stir just 1 tablespoon of sauce into the rice in step 9. For a true bibimbap experience, bring the pot to the table before stirring the vegetables into the rice in step 9.",korean,KOR

Add ramen noodles and cook for 2-3 minutes until chewy. Remember, you're going to be frying these, so they'll be soft by the time you're done.
Drain the noodles and keep them close by.
Add the oil and chopped onions, bell pepper, and carrots to a heated frying pan or wok. Cook, stirring every once in a while, over medium heat for 1 minute.
The vegetables will still be crunchy, but it's time to add the noodles. Pour the noodles into the pan and stir to mix the noodles and vegetables. Cook, stirring frequently, until the noodles don't seem slick and wet anymore.
Add the soy sauce, and let it sit and sizzle for a few seconds before stirring to incorporate. This makes it so that it caramelizes a bit and burns off any excess liquid, so that your noodles don't get wet. Stir to incorporate.
Add the Shin Ramyun spicy seasoning packet to taste. I don't add the whole packet; some of this is reserved for another use because the flavor is just so darn delicious.
Transfer noodles to a bowl, or fry for a minute or two more if you'd like. The vegetables will have steamed a bit to a soft al dente at their peak from the noodles' original wetness, and the whole dish is now dry and beautiful. This definitely isn't your soft, saucy ramen, and it lends a nice, distinct texture.

DIPPING SAUCE: In a small non-reactive bowl combine the dipping sauce and set aside to marinate. Best prepared several hours in advance.
MEAT FILLING: In a large bowl combine the filling ingredients. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
To make a simple paste for sealing the wrappers, in another small bowl combine a few tablespoons of water and roughly 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Stir to blend.  Place about 3/4 tablespoon of the meat mixture on one dim sum wrapper. Using your fingers or a pastry brush, add a little bit of the water/cornstarch mixture to the edge of the wrapper. Fold over the wet edges so they meet and they should look like mini-turnovers. Be sure edges are sealed firmly so that the dim sum do not fall apart during cooking.
(If you own a dim sum wrapper maker use that. If you don't own one, considering investing in a dim sum wrapper. They are inexpensive and come in very handy! A small turnover maker will also work.).
Place the filled dim sum singly on parchment or waxed paper lined cookie sheet. Fill all the dim sum wrappers.
FRYING THE DIM SUM: In large saute pan, on medium-high heat the peanut oil, approximately 1 tablespoon. Add the dim sum in batches, DO NOT crowd, and fry  until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes.
Once golden, add 1/4 cup of broth or water, cover pan and bring to boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cook for about 20 minutes or until liquid is evaporated and dim sum are tender but not gummy . Serve immediately.
STEAMING THE DIM SUM: Place a large bamboo steamer inside a large stock pot. Fill with water so that the water does not exceed the  bottom of the first level or tier of the steamer basket. Lightly oil the inside of the bamboo steamer basket so that the gyoza do not stick. Arrange the dim sum singly in the bamboo steamer, cover and bring water to boil. FYI- Don't put the cover on the stock pot, only the bamboo steamer.

Place the section of one piece of dough upward, flatten the little dough slightly with you palm, and then roll it out into a flat circle, about four to five inches in diameter (if you want your pies look good, you should try you best to prevent the red rings in the middle from any distortion). Wrap a portion of filling (shaped in a ball) with the flat dough (you can cover the filling with the flat dough, place the section on the top, and wrap the filling by sealing the dough at the bottom.) Do this for the rest of the doughs and filling. Here you get the uncooked pies LOL!

Yaya's Empanadas,30,,5 cups all-purpose flour,"Dough:  Combine the 5 cups of flour and baking powder in a large bowl.  Cut in the margarine until the mixture has a crumbly consistency.  In a small pot boil the soy milk with 1 tablespoons salt.  Pour the boiling liquid into the flour mixture and mix without kneading.  Cover with a tea towel and let the dough rest for approximately 1/2 hour.  It is very important to let the dough rest at this stage or you will not be able to roll it out.  
Filling:  Heat the oil in a pot or a saucepan that has a tight-fitting lid.  Add the ground meat, diced onion and spices.  Stir.  If using raisins they should be mixed in at this stage so that the flavours blend into each other during cooking. Cover, reduce heat, and let cook for approximately 15 minute or until the meat is cooked through and the onions are transparent.  The mixture will release liquid during cooking. If the mixture looks dry (the liquid may have evaporated if the heat was too high, or due to an ill-fitting lid) you can add a couple fo tablespoons of water.  Take off the stove and stir in 1 tablespoons of flour.  Let cool.  
Assembly:  Roll out dough using extra flour to avoid sticking.  Cut out large circles.  Fill each circle with  approximately 1 heaping tablespoon of meat, 1 slice of hardboiled egg, and 1 black olive.  Dab the perimeter of the dough with a tiny bit of water to help seal the edges.  
Folding:  There are 2 ways to fold the empanada (if making 2 types of filling you can use the 2 different syle of folding the empanada to distinguish between them).  Method A:  Fold the circle in half to form a semi-circle.  Pinch the edges all the way around the circle.  Method B: Fold the circle in half to make a semi-circle.  Fold over the rounded edge of the semi-circle to make a rectangle. Now fold over both sides edges of the dough to make an ""envelope"" shape. Press the corners.  This option only seems more complicated than the first.  It is best because it results in a more secure seal, although some juices inevitably escape during baking!

Creamy Manjar (Dulce de Leche),90,50 servings,1 gallon whole milk,"Combine milk, sugar, sweetener, and vanilla in the biggest pot you have. Place over medium heat and stir until sugar dissolves. Increase heat and bring to a rolling boil.

As soon as it boils, combine water and baking soda in a small bowl and stir to dissolve; don't worry if it doesn't dissolve completely.

Remove pot from the stove and place in the sink. Add baking soda mixture and stir vigorously as milk will expand rapidly-be prepared! When the mixture returns to its original volume, return the pot to the stove and bring to a very brisk simmer. It may concern you that it will scorch, but it should be practically boiling. Cook, checking and stirring occasionally, until it turns a deep golden brown, about 1 hour.

After the mixture has turned dark caramel in color, check it more frequently. The longer you cook it after the color change, the thicker it will be. For a consistency similar to caramel, cook for another 15 minutes. For a thicker, spreadable consistency, cook for another 20 to 25 minutes. For a candy-like consistency, cook it even longer. Just remember that it will thicken up tremendously after cooling.

Once you're ready, pour the caramel into a plastic container with a lid, or pour into jars. It can be kept without refrigeration, but with refrigeration it is good for many weeks.
